<h1><em>Mental Illness</em></h1>
<p>When someone is hospitalized with a physical illness like cancer or heart disease, it’s common for friends and neighbors to bring food to that family: casseroles, breads, cookies and more.
On the other hand, when an individual is diagnosed with a behavioral health disorder — either mental illness or substance abuse – the scenario is much different. 
Not only do we not deliver any food or support, but we rarely talk about it and it’s not unusual to avoid the impacted family or individual.
Unfortunately, this type of stigma is nothing compared to the discrimination that people with behavioral health conditions face.</p>
</p>
<p>

<b>How does mental health affect physical health?-</b><br>
<p>
There are various ways in which poor mental health has been shown to be detrimental to physical health.
People with the highest levels of self-rated distress (compared to lowest rates of distress) were 32% more likely to have died from cancer.Depression has been found to be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease.
 
<br><br>
Schizophrenia is associated with:<br>
	<ul>
    <li>double the risk of death from heart disease</li>
    <li>three times the risk of death from respiratory disease.</li>
	</ul>

This is because people with mental health conditions are less likely to receive the physical healthcare they're entitled to. 
Mental health service users are statistically less likely to receive the routine checks (like blood pressure, weight and cholesterol) that might detect symptoms of these physical health conditions earlier. They are also not as likely to be offered help to give up smoking, reduce alcohol consumption and make positive adjustments to their diet.
